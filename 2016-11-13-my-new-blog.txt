Welcome to my new blog!

I've been wanting to make a blog for a while now.[--more--] I've always wanted something I could use to post all my personal projects, express ideas and more. This website is meant to show off what I do as a young, aspiring computer scientist.

I'm not really expecting anybody to read it unless I make an interesting post or something, it's really more for me. I would like to keep track of my progress throughout the years and also have a nice place to be able to show and prove to future employers that I have the skills to do the job.

If anyone is curious, this blog is made with [Yellow CMS](https://developers.datenstrom.se/)
